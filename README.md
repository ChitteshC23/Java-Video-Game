# Java-Video-Game
 - Welcome to my Crossy Road video game recreation
 - I developed a highly responsive video game application called Crossy Road with an adaptable design to ensure optimal user experience on multiple platforms, showcased through successful deployment and positive user feedback
 - For the video game to sucessfully work, you need to make sure...
     - All the java files (.java) in the "CrossyRoad" folder has been download
     - All the game images in the "Game Images" folder is download
     - Finally, all the game images & the java code are all under the same project file in your IDE
